# PSI Team Hub

## Preparation

Make sure you create a .env based on .env.example.

## Development

We're using vagrant, you can just go ahead and do `vagrant up`.
Right after you can access the app at localhost:8000.

When using the PHP artisan, `vagrant ssh` into the box and `cd psi`. Artisan
will have access to the database.
